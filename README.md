## Problem Statement ##
A lot of people have turned to Etsy to buy/sell their custom crafts. The problem with Etsy is that
they consume a portion of your sales and charge you to post your products with a monthly fee.
Custom Crafts will allow crafters to sell for no charge at all. Custom Crafts also includes 
a small accounting assistant to document all sales and customers may choose to enter their costs
to see a total revenue amount.
