- Peer review (1.5h)
I didn't log exactly what I completed in the time I spent working on the indie project, but I began
working on templating my jsp pages from an html template online. Starting working on the index page and getting
data from the database to display on the page. Set up the product details page to grab whichever product information
from the product that was click on to display all details, and to grab similar tags to display like products on the bottom.
## Week 15 ##
7 hours:
Continued to work on templating jsp pages, doing them as I need when connecting how pages are interacting.
Set up log in page and sign up page, got new users to show up in the database. Realized I may need to do some extra work to 
keep a user logged in/continue displaying their personal information where needed. 
## Week 16 ##
...23 hours:
Worked on getting the project back up and running in AWS, made some finishing touched to the project.
Added the ability to edit/delete products from the myAccount page. Changed my account to be a protected page for
